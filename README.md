# IIT-Kanpur-Campus-Shortest-Path-Finder
# 🗺️ IIT Kanpur Campus Pathfinding  
A C++ implementation of **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find the shortest path between locations on the IIT Kanpur campus, featuring a **custom graph data structure**, **STL containers**, and a **graphical interface using SFML**.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Optimal Pathfinding** — Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest route between two points.  
- **Custom Graph Structure** — Designed and optimized for quick queries and easy scalability.  
- **Efficient Data Management** — Uses STL containers like `std::vector`, `std::unordered_map`, and `std::priority_queue`.  
- **Console Interface** — For quick text-based queries and debugging.  
- **Graphical Interface (SFML)** — Visualizes the IIT Kanpur campus map with animated pathfinding.  
- **Step-by-Step Animation** — See the algorithm explore nodes in real time.  

## 🖥️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: C++17  
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra’s Shortest Path  
- **Libraries**:  
  - STL (`vector`, `unordered_map`, `priority_queue`)  
  - [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphics and animation

## 📂 Project Structure  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- C++17 or later  
- [SFML 2.5+](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) installed and linked  
- CMake (optional, for easier building)  

### Build & Run (Linux/Mac)  
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iitk-pathfinding.git
cd iitk-pathfinding

# Build with CMake
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run
./iitk_pathfinding

If you want, I can also add **badges** (like C++ version, license, SFML used) so your GitHub page looks even more professional. That would make it pop visually.
